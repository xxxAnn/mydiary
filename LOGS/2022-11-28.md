Hi, this is the first post.
Today I basically just made this website (also some math assigments).
I feel like making this site took some pretty creatives step so i'll talk about them here.
So at first I wanted to do a kind of pie menu where you could select any blog post from a circle.
Kinda like this ![Pie menu](https://i.imgur.com/0IDNigA.png).
There are a few problem with this. First if you have a lot of blog posts it'll overflow.
Well... *technically*, it wont overflow, there'll just be so many tiny circles it'll be basically impossible to select anything.
Another problem is that it's kind of painful to make. It's not that difficult *per se*, it's just that it requires a lot of 
JavaScript calculations (& trig) to calculate positions for each of the nodes. So yeah... I decided I won't do that. ~~(im bad at js lmao)~~
So next I actually tried make something ressembling a zettelkasten graph.
