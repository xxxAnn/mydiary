<div class='main'><p>So today I want to the library in mtl. My goal was to do some research on the labor history of Quebec. I had two books I wanted to find but spoiler alert I found neither. So I took the bus, took the subway and I was in the library. The first book I looked for is called <em>Le droit de se taire, Histoire des communistes au Québec de la Premi:ère Guerre mondiale à la Révolution tranquille</em>, I didn't find it but near where it was supposed to be I found this book<br />

So I read it and found some pretty interesting things. So we learn about labor unions in Quebec a lot, but surprisingly a lot of the large modern Quebec labor unions come from anti-communist labor unions who were explicitly trying to prevent radicalization of workers. The big union we know today as CSN used to be called the CTCC and it was pretty openly trying to prevent labor movements from gaining traction. Religion was actually a really big deal for early left wing movements in Quebec. A lot of people felt like they had to choose between their religion and their politics, and people would often be shamed for being a leftist and told they would go to hell for their non-catholic value. These catholic labor unions were staunchly against international unions and any form of marxist labor organizing. Now I'm not saying they didn't fight for workers, they did. They were just not very radical, and it took them very long to adopt any form of socialist ideas. So yeah back then your religion was a pretty big deal when it came to politics. Now, I read all that, took some notes then I went eat ( sushi :&gt; ) and came back. It was time for me to look for the second book. The book I was looking for was called <em>The History of the labour movement in Québec</em>. I couldn't find it either but instead I found <em>Le syndicalisme québécois</em> by <strong>Jacques Rouillard</strong>. It was also very interesting. I learned of early labor organizing in Quebec city and Montreal. How migrants were some of the people doing most labor organizing. It's interesting to notice the very early rift between French speaking and English speaking labor unions and how they already fought each other as early as the mid 1800s. The book also explains how important railroads were the formation of international labor unions. Well, anyway, that's basically what I did today.</p></div>
