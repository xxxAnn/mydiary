<p>Hi, this is the first post.<br />
Today I basically just made this website (also some math assigments).<br />
I feel like making this site took some pretty creatives step so i'll talk about them here.<br />
So at first I wanted to do a kind of pie menu where you could select any blog post from a circle.<br />
Kinda like this <br><img alt="Pie menu" src="https://i.imgur.com/0IDNigA.png" />.<br />
There are a few problem with this. First if you have a lot of blog posts it'll overflow. Well... <em>technically</em>, it wont overflow, there'll just be so many tiny circles it'll be basically impossible to select anything. Another problem is that it's kind of painful to make. It's not that difficult <em>per se</em>, it's just that it requires a lot of JavaScript calculations (&amp; trig) to calculate positions for each of the nodes. So yeah... I decided I won't do that. (im bad at js lmao) So next I actually tried make something ressembling a zettelkasten graph. Now if you don't know what that is I'll explain it a bit later cause it's kind of interesting. Anyway for now what I tried to do was basically nodes, connected one below (or next) to the other. At that point in time I kinda new I wanted a kinda of simplistic layout, at risk of it not being extremely aesthetically pleasing. I feel like that's more interesting and represents me better. So I tried doing that. Uhm... How do I put this... It's incredibly difficult. You see there's this thing called an SVG. It's basically an image (if you're a web designer pretend you didn't read that). I thought I could use those to basically draw lines between each of the boxes (nodes). There's just one problem. It's incredibly painful to get SVG files to align with HTML objects especially when those are set on relative positions (which means they aren't using an absolute coordinate system and are instead relative to their "parent", the object that contains them). There's another problem, if I want to include a large amount of information these small boxes won't be sufficient, and having a gigantic graph full of tons of giant boxes doesn't seem, let's say, optimal. This is basically how I arrived at the current model you see. Instead of having a complex graph with many nodes, I just decided to have one line, in chronological order, with nodes that expand when you hover on them. The code for this is actually pretty simple and is like 99% css. This is the only useful JS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    var LOGS = {}

    document.body.onload = function(event) {
        t = document.getElementById(&quot;thething&quot;)
        t.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;
        Object.keys(LOGS).forEach(x =&gt; t.innerHTML += `
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot; id=&quot;${x}&quot; onmouseenter=&quot;
                document.getElementById('${x}').innerHTML = \`${LOGS[x]}\`
            &quot; onmouseleave=&quot;
                document.getElementById('${x}').innerHTML = '${x}'
            &quot;&gt;${x}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        `)
    }
</code></pre>
<p>If you know JS this might looks useless/stupid and if you don't know it it might looks scary/imposing. But don't fret my friend for your friendly neighbourhood Ann shall explain it.</p>
