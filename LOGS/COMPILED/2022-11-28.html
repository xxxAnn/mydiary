<p>Hi, this is the first entry.<br />
Today I basically just made this website (also some math assignments).<br />
I feel like making this site took some pretty creatives step so i'll talk about them here.<br />
So at first I wanted to do a kind of pie menu where you could select any blog post from a circle.<br />
Kinda like this <br><img alt="Pie menu" src="https://i.imgur.com/0IDNigA.png" />.<br />
There are a few problem with this. First if you have a lot of blog posts it'll overflow. Well... <em>technically</em>, it wont overflow, there'll just be so many tiny circles it'll be basically impossible to select anything. Another problem is that it's kind of painful to make. It's not that difficult <em>per se</em>, it's just that it requires a lot of JavaScript calculations (&amp; trig) to calculate positions for each of the nodes. So yeah... I decided I won't do that. (im bad at js lmao) So next I actually tried make something ressembling a zettelkasten graph. Now if you don't know what that is I'll explain it a bit later cause it's kind of interesting. Anyway for now what I tried to do was basically nodes, connected one below (or next) to the other. At that point in time I kinda new I wanted a kinda of simplistic layout, at risk of it not being extremely aesthetically pleasing. I feel like that's more interesting and represents me better. So I tried doing that. Uhm... How do I put this... It's incredibly difficult. You see there's this thing called an SVG. It's basically an image (if you're a web designer pretend you didn't read that). I thought I could use those to basically draw lines between each of the boxes (nodes). There's just one problem. It's incredibly painful to get SVG files to align with HTML objects especially when those are set on relative positions (which means they aren't using an absolute coordinate system and are instead relative to their "parent", the object that contains them). There's another problem, if I want to include a large amount of information these small boxes won't be sufficient, and having a gigantic graph full of tons of giant boxes doesn't seem, let's say, optimal. This is basically how I arrived at the current model you see. Instead of having a complex graph with many nodes, I just decided to have one line, in chronological order, with nodes that expand when you hover on them. The code for this is actually pretty simple and is like 99% css. This is the only useful JS:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    var LOGS = {}

    document.body.onload = function(event) {
        t = document.getElementById(&quot;thething&quot;)
        t.innerHTML = &quot;&quot;
        Object.keys(LOGS).forEach(x =&gt; t.innerHTML += `
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot; id=&quot;${x}&quot; onmouseenter=&quot;
                document.getElementById('${x}').innerHTML = \`${LOGS[x]}\`
            &quot; onmouseleave=&quot;
                document.getElementById('${x}').innerHTML = '${x}'
            &quot;&gt;${x}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        `)
    }
</code></pre>
<p>If you know JS this might looks useless/stupid and if you don't know it it might looks scary/imposing. But don't fret my friend for your friendly neighbourhood Ann shall explain it. So basically all this code does is use the LOGS dictionary to make each of the nodes (boxes). Basically the dictionary's key is used as the front (the thing that shows when you're not hovering on the box) and the value is what is inside. The actual value is actually embedding another HTML which is automatically generated by a python script I made that converts a markdown file (which I am writing in right now). That was one hell of a sentence let me break it down. First I write in a markdown file generated by the python script. Then the python script automatically notices a change in the file and automatically updates all the javascript files as well as updates the HTML file version of this markdown file. The python script generates a JavaScript file that basically just adds all of that to the LOGS variable for it to all work (also it automatically adds a link to that javascript file in the main html file). Doing all this manually all the time would be a headache so this saves a lot of time. Well, anyway that's basically how my setup works.</p>
<h2>zettelkasten</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a> is a way of taking notes that consists of writing small independent notes, and arranging them by category while keeping track of all the links between each of the indenpendent note. This is an incredibly efficient way to do research since you automatically see all the connections with all the concepts as you build a graph of all the connections between your notes. The word Zettelkasten basically just means slip box because that's how it was originally used, but now it's often used with computers making the process of graphing the connections much simpler. That's basically it. I'll talk about it again if I do more stuff with it.</p></div>
